 Variable Name                 Type                   Description
 ledPinOutput                  int                    Sends signals through input digital pin 7 to control LED.
 button1                       int                    Retrieves button input value from input digital pin 8. 
 button2                       int                    Retrieves button input value from input digital pin 9. 
 button3                       int                    Retrieves button input value from input digital pin 10. 
 
 button1Pressed                int                    Reads the value of button1 if it is HIGH/LOW.
 button2Pressed                int                    Reads the value of button2 if it is HIGH/LOW.
 button3Pressed                int                    Reads the value of button3 if it is HIGH/LOW.
 
 lastButtonState1              int                    Checks if the last button state was HIGH/LOW in each loop for button1. 
 lastButtonState2              int                    Checks if the last button state was HIGH/LOW in each loop for button2.
 lastButtonState3              int                    Checks if the last button state was HIGH/LOW in each loop for button3.
 buttonState1                  int                    Stores the current state of button1. 
 buttonState2                  int                    Stores the current state of button2. 
 buttonState3                  int                    Stores the current state of button3. 
 
 buttonNum                     int                    This is for checking which button was pressed. The values can be seen in the Serial Monitor.
 
 ledState                      int                    Sets the LED state to either HIGH or LOW.
 delaySpeed                    long                   Sets the delay speed of how long the LED should turn on/off.
 previousMs                    long                   Sets the previous millisecond values to figure out when LED should turn on/off.
